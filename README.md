## Omaha High Poker

Omaha High Poker, also known as Omaha Hold'em, is a popular variation of poker that offers a unique twist to the traditional Texas Hold'em game. This README provides an overview of the game, its rules, and the objective of the project.

### Game Description

In Omaha High Poker, players are dealt four private hole cards, unlike the two cards in Texas Hold'em. The goal is to create the best possible five-card hand using exactly two of the hole cards and three of the community cards. This means that players must strategically choose which hole cards to use in combination with the shared community cards.

One significant difference between Omaha High and Texas Hold'em is that players are required to use precisely two of their hole cards to form their final hand, whereas in Texas Hold'em, any combination of hole cards and community cards can be used.

The betting rounds in Omaha High follow a similar structure to Texas Hold'em, including pre-flop, flop, turn, and river. Different betting structures such as limit, pot-limit, or no-limit can be applied to the game, adding to its versatility.

Omaha High Poker is known for its fast-paced action and strategic complexity. With four hole cards, players have a wider range of potential hand combinations, requiring careful consideration and selection of the community cards to make informed decisions.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to design an algorithm and implement a C++ program that can determine the winning hand between two Omaha High Poker hands. The program will analyze the provided input file "distrib/input.txt" and generate the output file "distrib/output.txt" with the results of the hand comparison.

### Running the Program

To run the program, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the "omaha-high-poker" directory.
2. Execute the command: `.\omaha-high-poker\x64\Release\omaha-high-poker.exe .\distrib\input.txt .\distrib\output.txt`.

Please ensure that you have the necessary files in the specified directories before running the program.
